# Web Platform Incubator Community Group

This repository is being used for work in the Web Platform Incubator Community Group, governed by the [W3C Community License 
Agreement (CLA)](http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/). To contribute, you must join 
the CG. 

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all 
contributors in the pull request's body or in subsequent comments.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the 
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.

## Style guide
The spec is written in markdown and generated with [ReSpec](http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/ReSpec.js/documentation.html).

When contributing text, just follow the conventions in the document. Please note that some GitHub flavored markdown won't work (e.g., denoting the programming language in a code block).

Please check that everything is ok locally (by opening index.html in the browser) before sending a pull request.
